# RunTime Analysis
This practice will mainly deal on how to analyse the an algorithm. By analysing an algorithm, we will measure
its performance on different data inputs. By measuring its performance we will be able to choose the best 
of the available algorithms to achieve a given task.
## Annotation of Run time algorithm 
* Omega - the lower bound of algorithm run time ( minimum time run) - best case scenario 
* Big-o(O) - the upper bound of an algorithm run time (maximum time to run) - worst case scenario
* Theta - the average run time ( its between Omega and Big-o) - average scenario  

##Different types of  algorithm run time complexities
* Big-o(1) - Constant - Adding an element at the front of the linked list 
* Big-o(logn) - Logarithmic - Finding an element in a sorted array
* Big-o(n) - Linear  - Finding an element in unsorted array
* Big-o(nlogn) - Linear logarithmic  - Merge sort
* Big-o(n**2) - Quadratic - Finding shortest path between two nodes in a graph
* Big-o(n**3)- Cubic - Matrix multiplication 
* Big-o(2pow(n) - Exponential - Tower of Hanoi problem
