# Data structure and Algorithm 
This session will cover about different types of data structure and algorithms.
The following concepts will be covered in detail both theoretically and practically.
1. Introduction to Data structure and algorithm

    - Brief introduction to data structure and algorithm
    - Mainly theoretically 
2. Recursion

    - The concepts of recursion
    - Why recursion
    - comparison of recursion and iteration
    - Exercises 
3. Algorithm Run Time Analysis

    - The concepts of run time analysis
    - Why analysing run time for algorithm
    - comparing run times of different algorithms that does the same task
    - Exercises
