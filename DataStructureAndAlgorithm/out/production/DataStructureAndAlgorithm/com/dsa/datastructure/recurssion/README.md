# Recursion properties of recursion #
1. It should follow the same operation multiple times with different inputs
2. Every step the problem gets smaller
3. There should be a base condition, it helps to end the recursion. 
If there is no base condition the it will be infinite loop which is a problem.

## Format of recursive function
* Recursive case - the case where the function recur.
* Base case - the case that stops the recursive call.
